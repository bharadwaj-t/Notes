# Understanding Algorithms

## Points to remember:
1. I do have some prior understanding of these subjects but it is superficial. The goal is to push for proficiency.
2. The learning trajectory keeps changing as I keep discovering things I am wrong about, course correction will happen. Proabably will be reflected in the commit messages.

## Resources:
1. Mathematics for Computer Science: [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#math):
	- Book: lecture notes by László Lovász
2. The Alogrithm Design Manual

TIP: You can use library genesis to "preview" the book before buying it ;)
